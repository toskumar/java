# Java Design Patterns
## Creational Design Patterns

* __Abstract Factory__ Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
* __Builder__  Uses to create complex objects.
* __Factory Method__  Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
* __Prototype__  Creates a new object from an existing object.
* __Singleton__  Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

## Structural Design Patterns
* __Adapter__  Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
* __Bridge__  Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
* __Composite__  Takes a group of objects into a single object.
* __Decorator__  Allows for an object’s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
* __Facade__  Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
* __Flyweight__  Reduces the cost of complex object models.
* __Proxy__  Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

## Behavior Design Patterns
* __Chain of Responsibility__  Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
* __Command__  Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
* __Interpreter__  Implements a specialized language.
* __Iterator__  Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* __Mediator__  Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
* __Memento__  Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
* __Observer__ Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
* __State__  Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* __Strategy__  Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
* __Template Method__  Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
* __Visitor__  Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
