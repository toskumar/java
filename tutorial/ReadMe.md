# Java Tutorial

__Procedural Language__ is based on the concept of the procedure call. A procedure is a set of instruction which has one or more input parameters and output parameter.
```C
function areaOfCircle(int radius) {
  return 3.14 * radius * radius;
}
```
__Object Oriented Language__ programming style which use objects that contain both data and code.
```java
class Circle {
 int radius;
 Circle (int radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
 }
 int area() {
  return 3.14 * this.radius * this.radius 
 }
}
```
__Abstraction__ is a process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
```java
Bike {
 Engine engine;
 void kickStart(){
  this.engine.start();
 }
 void keyStop() {
    this.engine.stop()
 }
}
```
